 Jenny lay in a bluish heat like a wasted dream. Her face was wrong. The ancient clock pushed
 time around on the shelf. Mama stood with a leather frown. Mama felt like some
 hysterical clown with a concrete pie and shoes that were far too big. The doctor
 came with his bag of bones. The soulcatcher crouched on the window sill
 with a gramophone. The doctor scratched his head and walked over to Jenny's
 sweating incest. His hands froze as he touched her. The birds peered from their bamboo cage
 The soulcatcher. La la la la...
 Soulcatcher. La la la la...
 Soulcatcher. La la la la...
 La la la.
 Mama popped and said,
 How can we make her stay?
 When she talked to us, we thought about leaving.
 Jenny looked through poisoned eyes,
 As a sick tune played on the gramophone.
 The doctor sighed and said,
 Jenny won't change anymore.
 Papa fled to the kitchen light,
 Mama just spun in a crying jag,
 Whispering softly to herself.
 The soulcatcher winked and grinned.
 The doctor put the clinical toys away,
 And rode off on a push bike.
 And Jenny saw some Indians that rode in circles over.
 As the music got faster and faster,
 She called out to the soulcatcher.
 La la la la...
 Soulcatcher.
 La la la la...
 Soulcatcher.
 La la la la...
 The birds flew round their cage,
 And broke their stupid wings,
 As the room seemed to stop breathing.
 The soulcatcher took Jenny's soul away,
 And hung it up to dry on a big plain tree,
 Whispering softly to himself.
 He tapped his foot and turned around,
 And disappeared down through a hole in the ground,
 Where nothing means everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
 Everything.
