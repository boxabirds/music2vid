 When I wander, see right through you, flying high in pretty voodoo, lucid dreaming magic
 wonder, can you see this spell I'm under?
 Make you wonder with that rhythm, feel it moving through your system
 Step on, step us, step up, do it, all you gotta do is do it, do it, yeah
 We come to do it, yeah, yeah, we come to do it, yeah, yeah, we come to do it, yeah, yeah
 I got the wandering name, mm-hmm I got the wandering name, mm-hmm
 I got the wandering name, mm-hmm
 I got the wandering name- Oh, you know I got it, oh you know
 Oh, spots on it's crazy, same everybody gets a picture in my magazine
 Just like the paparazzi, you won't even ask me no, no
 Well all you got to do is just show people look up
 I can't help but spy from my wandering eye
 Something beginning with the capital Q, capital U
 If you could only check my view, we come to do, yeah
 We come to do, yeah
 We come to do, yeah
 We come to do, yeah
 I got the wandering name, mm-hmm
 I got the wandering name, mm-hmm
 I got the wandering name, mm-hmm
 I got the wandering name, oh you know I got it, oh you know
 Feels like I can't sit still when I got it, when I got it
 All around I say keep on searching, oh I got it, yes I got it
 When will this cease, never gonna end
 Lost my family, lost my friends
 This place is familiar, far from the same
 I'm a little closer, let me know your name
 We'll step into the light, sweet one, so I can see who you were
 What's your name in the moonlight, yeah
 What's your name in the street, yeah
 You know, you know, you're looking so good, you're looking so fine, yeah
 I can tell by the way that you're looking up at my sweet one
 Sweet one, sweet one, sweet one
 I can tell by the way, I can tell by the way
 I can tell by the way
 I can tell by the way
 I can tell by the way
 I can tell by the way
 I can tell by the way
 Oh, oh, oh
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look up high, look up high
 Look
