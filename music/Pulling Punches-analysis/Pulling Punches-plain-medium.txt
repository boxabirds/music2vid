 Everyone watches over me, and someone sits back in the store
 With eyes that say, hands that feel
 Why am I the last to know sheltered life spent partially breathing?
 Gathered together under new religion
 Pulling punches, moving, sleeping on our feet
 Pulling punches, I needed someone to comfort me
 Raised in summer days of splendor
 Would have dreamed of love never ending
 A better world lies in front of me
 A sketch of life and the books I read
 Then as I walk where heaven leads
 Why am I the last to know simple lives spent partially breathing?
 Gathered together under new religion
 Pulling punches, moving, sleeping on our feet
 Pulling punches, I needed someone to comfort me
 Raised in summer days of splendor
 Would have dreamed of love never ending
 Nature leads
 There's no zeal
 Deep inside the heart of new
 Sheltered lives spent partially breathing
 Gathered together under new religion
 Pulling punches, moving, sleeping on our feet
 Pulling punches, I needed someone to comfort me
 Raised in summer days of splendor
 Would have dreamed of love never ending
