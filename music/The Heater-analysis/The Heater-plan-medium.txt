 Frank border heater, an electric heater, the elements were made of wire and clay, reached out to touch and he heard a voice say,
 Everybody say, Come on and plug me in, I want to feel that heat begin,
 Don't move till the morning comes, and you can fly up to the sun, so come on and plug me in, plug me in, plug me in.
 Frank liked his heater, his electric heater, upstairs alone with the elements he dreamt of gold and frankincense,
 and frankincense, and heard it say, Come on and plug me in, I want to feel that heat begin,
 Come closer and smile and say, I want to melt your precious wings, so come on and plug me in, plug me in, plug me in.
 Come on and plug me in, come on and plug me in, I want to feel that heat begin,
 Though my body is rusting through, I have carried this song for you, it's from the sphinx and the serpent to plug me in,
