 Did I ever tell you about that man who changed my life?
 The one I thought, oh my lord, when I saw him walking back to that bar,
 all tall and lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips.
 I knew that I had died and gone to chocolate heaven.
 I had a real deep voice, white, really deep, and this shoe was always shining.
 Long, slender fingers manicured perfectly.
 The man wore $800 Italian suits straight from, I don't know, what would they call it, Milan, Rome, some place like that.
 What was the logo?
 I said, I got to get next to that man, and I haven't seen him in a long time.
 I mean, he was so fine.
 He could get any good girl into trouble.
 You guys heard him say what?
 Well, the jackal.
 The jackal.
 He sure was fine.
 Jackal, jackal, jackal.
 He was fat, black, cat-cooled, like a Friday afternoon martini, chatting at a quarter after five.
 Twist of lime, coke on the side.
 The brother loved to highlight.
 Had a Ph.D. in street strut.
 They called him the jackal.
 He was big mac daddy, super black style, and a diamonds in the back Cadillac.
 Fur line boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, rum on everything.
 And the stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them, when they called him the jackal.
 Jackal, jackal, jackal.
 Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, living fast, living large, six foot four, not an ounce of fat.
 When women ask, is you a frown cat?
 He said, I did, I'm one in that.
 And in case you hadn't known, they called me the jackal.
 Served an 18-year bid for Rikers Island, and they hid him in the state penitentiary.
 Said the charge was grand loss.
 That was 1975.
 And today, if he's still alive, he'll be living in the park.
 The brother who claimed the fame was that they called him the jackal.
 The jackal.
 The jackal.
