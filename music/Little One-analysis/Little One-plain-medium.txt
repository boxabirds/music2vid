 Go to sleep, we're so tired now
 All together and asleep in our souls
 New days, though you've changed the way
 Try to hang your hopes on the wind
 Little one, just a little way
 Today, all we need is play
 Night rise, like the evening prize
 In the tent style, backwards we'd fly
 Cold bones, tied together by
 Black ropes we pull from the sleigh
 Little one, just a little way
 Today, our dreams are breaking
 Can't stand on crooked legs
 I'll crawl side to the wall
 When all these satellites go
 Down, down, sailors run aground
 In a sea change, nothing is safe
 Strange waves push us every way
 In a stolen boat, we'll float away
 Little one, just a little way
 Today, all we need is play
 Little one, just a little way
 Today, all our dreams are waking
 Little one, all of our dreams are waking
