 Where is the ritual?
 And tell me where, where is the taste?
 Where is the sacrifice?
 And tell me where, where is the faith?
 Someday, there'll be a cure for pain
 That's the day
 I throw my drugs away
 Find the cure for pain
 Where is the cave?
 Where the wise woman went?
 And tell me where, where's all that money that I've spent?
 I propose a toast
 To my self-control
 You see it crawling helpless on the floor
 Someday, there'll be a cure for pain
 That's the day
 I throw my drugs away
 Find the cure for pain
 Find the cure for pain
 Find the cure, find the cure for pain
