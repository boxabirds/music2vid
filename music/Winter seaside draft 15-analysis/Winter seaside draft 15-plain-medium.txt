 Driving down to the south coast thinking of the waves
 Watching the rolling green landscapes against the grey skies
 Braving the cold wind to get some fresh air
 Maybe it'll help us wake from winter breakfall
 Therefore we step gingerly over the stones
 Picnic math threatening to escape with a tug of invisible hands
 Back in the office, back to cardboard loyalties
 Of rainbow-coloured furniture, free coffee and tea
 Punctuated by water-cooler intimacy
 We work hard to play hard, we're a family
 Public transport held together with duct tape and patches
 Returning home to electric bills like fees and taxes
 Is this really how it turns out to be?
 Is this life for me?
 Some of us throw caution to the wind and go for a swim
 The salt will be good for our complexion, we say to ourselves
 Red-cheeked and flushed with adrenaline, we emerge from the waves
 Pale goosebumps of regret cover our body
 Fish and chips with newspaper flutter in the wind
 We eat defiantly, fending off seagulls
 Back in the office, back to cardboard loyalties
 Of rainbow-coloured furniture, free coffee and tea
 Punctuated by water-cooler intimacy
 We work hard to play hard, we're a family
 Public transport held together with duct tape and patches
 Returning home to electric bills like fees and taxes
 Is this really how it turns out to be?
 Is this life for me?
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
 The battle between land and sky comes to an end
 Bowing in the face of heavy drops of rain
 Back up the hill, we return to the recluse of our car
 Snakes of rain through car headlights crawl on the window
 Driving back home, we huddle in the darkness of dusk
 The haters struggling to warm up the cold air we brought in
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
 At the winter seaside
 Some people call us crazy, but we know why we're here
 It's to feel alive, feel alive, feel alive
