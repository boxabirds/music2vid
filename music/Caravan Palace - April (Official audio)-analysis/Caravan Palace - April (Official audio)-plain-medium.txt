 Wild spring, raging in the street
 April, please, lower your gun
 Cold wind, new branches on the tree
 April, please, help me to run
 Running in the nature
 Away from the past
 Pretty as a picture
 I'm cheering up so fast
 Grey steam, waving on my street
 April, please, lower your gun
 Blurred dreams, playing on repeat
 April, please, help me to run
 Running in the nature
 Away from the past
 Pretty as a picture
 I'm cheering up so fast
 Running in the nature
 Pretty as a picture
 I'm cheering up so fast
 A giant swing, hanging from my tree
 My dear friend, you've been the one
 Large fields, unexplored lovely things
 April, please, help me to run
