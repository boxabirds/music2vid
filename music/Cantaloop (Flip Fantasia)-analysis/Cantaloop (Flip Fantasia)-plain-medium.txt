 Ladies and gentlemen, as you know we have something special down here at Birdland this evening.
 A recording for Blue Note Records.
 Yeah! What's that? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Funky! Funky!
 Now! Wait a minute!
 Groovy, groovy, jazzy, funky. Bounce, bounce, dance as we dip into the melodic sea.
 Rhythm keeps flowing and drips to MC. Sweet sugar pop, sugar pop, rocks pop. You don't stop till the sweet beat drops.
 I shall improve as I stick and move. Vivipones recited on top of the groove. Smooth mind floating like a butterfly.
 Nose set afloat, sung like a lullaby. Brace yourself as the beat hits ya. Dip ya in fantasia.
 What's that? Bidi bidi bop.
 Yeah! Bidi bidi bop.
 Funky! Funky!
 Feel the beat drop. Jazz and hip hop. Dripping in your dormancy zone and bop from confusion.
 A fly illusion keeps you coasting on the rhythm you're cruising. Up, down, round and round. Rounds are found but nevertheless you gots to get down.
 Fantasy freak through the grease so you need to move your feet to sweat from the heat.
 Back to the fact I'm the Mac and I know that. The way I kick the rhymes some would call me a poet.
 Pouring steady flow and growing showing sights and sound. Caught in the groove in fantasia I'm found.
 Many trips to tour upon the rhymes they soared to an infinite height. To the realm of the hardcore.
 Here we go. Off I take ya. Dip ya in the fantasia.
 What's that? Bidi bidi bop.
 Yeah! Bidi bidi bop.
 Funky! Funky!
 What's that? Bidi bidi bop.
 Yeah! Bidi bidi bop.
 Funky! Funky!
 Jump to the jam boogie woogie jam slam. Bust the dialect. I'm the man in command.
 Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master. Rhyming on the mic I'm bringing suckers their disaster.
 Who coo ducks but I still rock Nike. With the razzle dazzle star I might be.
 Scribble jabble scrabble on the microphone. I babble as I fix the funky words into a puzzle.
 Yes yes yes on and on as I flex it with the flow. Birds manifest. Feel the vibe from here to Asia.
 Dip ya in the fantasia.
 You don't stop come on come on come on come on come on come on give me more of that funky horn.
 What's that? Yeah!
 Funky! Funky!
 Bidi bidi bop. Bidi bidi bop.
 Funky! Funky!
 What's that? Bidi bidi bop.
 Yeah! Bidi bidi bop.
 What's that? Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 Funky! Funky!
 What's that? Bidi bidi bop.
 Yeah! Bidi bidi bop.
 Funky! Funky!
 What's that?
