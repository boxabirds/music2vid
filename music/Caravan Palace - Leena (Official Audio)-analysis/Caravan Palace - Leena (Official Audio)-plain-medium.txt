 Working in Paris.
 Pick me up.
 I'm gonna rise this evening
 And say to this heart
 That living is easy
 When you're living alone
 It's so cold, it's so cold
 Waiting for your favorite ride
 It's so cold, it's so cold
 Wait until you get in size
 It's so cold, it's so cold
 When I play your favorite part
 It's all gone, oh it's all gone
 Baby then I break your...
 Working in Paris.
 Pick me up.
 Oui c'est Ã§a.
 I'm gonna rise this evening
 Now we say our goodbyes
 That pretending was easy
 When you're late with a line
 Pick me up.
 Tonight.
 Pick me up.
