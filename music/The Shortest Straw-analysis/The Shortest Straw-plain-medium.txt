 Suspicion is your name, your honesty to pay, Predictability to say, it's not her.
 We touch modern day, Determination, decay, The place, disarray, disfigure.
 The public eyes, despise, define, commonplace, Unanity, faith, or taste, unanity.
 Dappening, painstaking, reckoning, This will echo in the spring.
 Shortest straw, talents, liberty, down by law, Living infamy, rapure, law.
 We jump right in through shortest straw, This shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Deaccusations lie, discrimination lie, Your inner self do die, intruding.
 Doubt sunk itself in you, it's to the talents though, No living guess to do deluding.
 A mass hysteria, a manualvania, Reveal dementia, free me all.
 Secretly, silently, certainly, Inverted though you will be.
 Shortest straw, talents, liberty, down by law, Living infamy, rapure, law.
 We jump right in through shortest straw, This shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Shortest straw.
 Pulled for you.
 Shortest straw.
 Pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
 Shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Behind you hands are tied, don't be ostracized.
 No hell is multiplied, avenging.
 The fall has begun, oppression damaged done.
 No money turned to none, to nothing.
 The origin yours not there, viewers disappear.
 The liars crystal clear, deep in the egg.
 Channels red, one word said.
 Blacklist dead, when for that y'all make you dead.
 Shortest straw.
 Talents liberty, done by law.
 Living infamy, rubbed you raw.
 We jump right in through shortest
 Shortest straw.
 This shortest straw has been pulled for you.
 Pulled for you.
