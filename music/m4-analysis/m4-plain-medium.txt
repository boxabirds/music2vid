 And I'm proving me involved
 Monday morning 5am, up before the birds, or at least so I'd hoped
 Time to get ahead, beat the rest and get on top
 And I'm proving me involved
 Now the day is rising, but behind grey clouds
 When will I see the blue, yellow sun and happy days?
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
 And I'm proving me involved
 Now I'm stuck in traffic, with no end in sight
 How can I get ahead, beat the rest and get on top?
 And I'm proving me involved
 Now the day is rising, but behind grey clouds
 When will I see the blue, yellow sun and happy days?
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
 All on open road, flying through green farmland, twisting through country lanes
 There's nothing quite like the freedom I feel
