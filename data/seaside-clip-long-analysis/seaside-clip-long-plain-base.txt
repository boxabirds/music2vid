 Driving down to the South Coast thinking of the waves
 Watching the rolling green landscapes against the grey skies
 Braving the cold wind to get some fresh air
 Maybe it'll help us wake from winter rainfall
 Therefore, we step gingerly over the stones
 Picnic math threatening to escape with a tug of invisible hands
 Back in the office, back to cardboard loyalties
 A rainbow colored furniture, free coffee and tea
 Won't you wait if I water cooler into my seat
 We work hard to play hard, we're a family
 Public transport held together with duct tape and patches
 Returning home to electric bills like bees and taxes
 Is this really how it turns out to be?
 Is this life for me?
